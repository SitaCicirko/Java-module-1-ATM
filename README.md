# Java-module-1-ATM
Create an ATM interface that contains:

Two methods that require implementation - deposit and withdrawal
A default method - information about connecting to the bank
A static method - information about the ATM shutting down
Then implement such an interface in a class named ATMImpl (ATM Implementation) 
and create bodies for the methods that require it. 
In the Application class in the main method, call each method.
